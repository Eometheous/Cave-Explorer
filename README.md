design more levels for the puzzle

M4 (3/4-3/15)

```
Flask is the Frontend and backend technology tool to be used
The algorithms/AI schemes used in the core engine
will most likely map algorithms like breadth-first search or depth-first search. 

The target group is children and older. It is straightforward with the puzzle being getting a turtle from the starting area to the ending area by sliding blocks around.
