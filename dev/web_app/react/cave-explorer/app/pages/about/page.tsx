        <p>
            Cave Explorer is a simple sliding puzzle game where the objective is to move a square piece from the starting slot to the end slot. The game consists of a square grid where the user interacts by clicking and dragging the white square to the top of the level.</p>

            As the player progresses, the game will gradually introduce more obstacles, such as blocks blocking the user's path, making the puzzles increasingly challenging.
